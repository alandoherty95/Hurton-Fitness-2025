                I love all kinds of exercise including swimming, lifting weights, running and hiking.
                Fitness has been my passion since I was 16 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through personal training, group classes, and bootcamps, my goal is simple:
                help people feel stronger, healthier, and more confident — without intimidation.

                        music. Best personal trainer by far and cannot wait to get back to his classes."</p>

                    <p>"I did aqua aerobics twice a week with Iain at Castletroy Park Hotel, all the women loved when
                        Iain was doing the class. His class was great fun, motivational and effective. His wonderful
                        playlists got us moving, old ladies forgot their aches and pains as they exercised to his great
                        music. He cheered everyone up, always had a smile, and his energy and dance moves were a joy to
                        watch."</p>

                    <p>"Iain was a very professional, courteous and patient swimming instructor. He had a very kind and
                        gentle approach to teaching, he acknowledged my fear in the water and personalised technigues
                        that helped me relax in the water and become confident in my abilities. Thanks to Iain I am now
                        confident in the water and absolutely love swimming. My confidence and ability has definitely
                        grown to a point where I now really enjoy my time in the gym. I highly recommend Iain as a
                        fitness/swim instructor for somebody wanting to reach their individual goals."</p>

                        improved in quality over time. Iain's classes are an excellent fit for me as they are varied and
                        fun. Iain is very professional and is always there early with class equipment set up ready to
                        greet participants as they arrive. He also has good session plans made but is comfortable to
                        adapt if an extra person turns up or if somebody joins in late."</p>
